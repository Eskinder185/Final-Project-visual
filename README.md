3D Scene Project: Coffee Mug and Table
Overview
This project is a simple 3D scene featuring a coffee mug on a tiled table. The mug is made from a cylinder for the main body and a torus for the handle. The table is a flat surface with a tiled texture. The scene includes basic lighting, shading, and camera controls, making it interactive and visually interesting.

Features
Objects:
A coffee mug and a tiled table.
Lighting:
Two light sources to make the scene realistic.
Camera Controls:
Use the mouse to look around and the W, A, S, D keys to move the camera.
Textures and Shading:
The mug, handle, and table have realistic material properties.
How to Navigate
Mouse: Move the camera view around to look at the scene.
Keyboard:
W, A, S, D: Move forward, backward, left, and right.
ESC: Exit the program.
What I Learned
This project helped me understand how to combine simple 3D shapes to create objects, use lighting to enhance visuals, and control a virtual camera. It also showed me the importance of keeping code organized with reusable functions.

Challenges
Positioning the mugâ€™s handle just right was tricky, but I eventually got it to look natural.
Balancing the light so it highlights the mug and table without making the scene too bright took some experimenting.
Future Ideas
Add shadows for a more realistic look.
Include reflections on the table surface.
Add more objects, like a spoon or a plate, to make the scene more detailed.
Conclusion
This project was a great way to learn the basics of 3D modeling and interaction. It gave me a solid foundation for creating more detailed and dynamic 3D scenes in the future.
